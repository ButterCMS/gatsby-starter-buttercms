Kick off your Gatsby + ButterCMS with this default boilerplate. 

[Live demo](https://gatsby-starter-buttercms.netlify.com/)


## 🚀 Quick start

1.  **Create a Gatsby site.**

    Use the Gatsby CLI to create a new site, specifying the default starter.

    ```sh
    # create a new Gatsby site using the default starter
    npx gatsby new my-default-starter https://github.com/butterCMS/gatsby-starter-buttercms
    ```
    
    If you run into an error with `npx`, you may need to first remove `node_modules` then run:
    
    ```
    yarn upgrade --latest
    yarn install
    gatsby develop
    ```
    

2. **Create Content**
   
   For this template to work, you have to create your content on ButterCMS
   as stated [here](https://buttercms.com/docs/api-client/gatsbyjs)

2. **Configuration**
    You need to add the API token from your dashboard, along with associated
    page types, content fileds, and pages.

    `gatsby-config-js`

    ```js
     {
        resolve: `gatsby-source-buttercms`,
        options: {
              authToken: `<API_TOKEN>`,
              // Optional array of Collection key 
              contentFields: {
                keys: [`collection_key`],
                // Optional. Set to 1 to enable test mode for viewing draft content.
                test: 0,
              },
              // Optional array of page type keys
              pageTypes: [`page_type_key`],
              // Optional array of locales (if configured in your account)
              locales: [`en`, `es`, `fr`],
              preview: 1 // Return draft content
        },
    }
    ```

1.  **Start developing.**

    Navigate into your new site’s directory and start it up.

    ```sh
    cd my-default-starter/
    gatsby develop
    ```

1.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._

    Open the `my-default-starter` directory in your code editor of choice and edit `src/pages/index.js`. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!

## 🧐 What's inside?

A quick look at the top-level files and directories you'll see in a Gatsby project.

    .
    ├── node_modules
    ├── src
    ├── gatsby-browser.js
    ├── gatsby-config.js
    ├── gatsby-node.js
    ├── gatsby-ssr.js
    ├── LICENSE
    ├── package-lock.json
    ├── package.json
    └── README.md

1.  **`/node_modules`**: This directory contains all of the modules of code that your project depends on (npm packages) are automatically installed.

2.  **`/src`**: This directory will contain all of the code related to what you will see on the front-end of your site (what you see in the browser) such as your site header or a page template. `src` is a convention for “source code”.

3.  **`gatsby-browser.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby browser APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/browser-apis/) (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting the browser.

4.  **`gatsby-config.js`**: This is the main configuration file for a Gatsby site. This is where you can specify information about your site (metadata) like the site title and description, which Gatsby plugins you’d like to include, etc. (Check out the [config docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/gatsby-config/) for more detail).

5.  **`gatsby-node.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby Node APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/node-apis/) (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting pieces of the site build process.

6.  **`gatsby-ssr.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby server-side rendering APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/ssr-apis/) (if any). These allow customization of default Gatsby settings affecting server-side rendering.

7.  **`LICENSE`**: Gatsby is licensed under the MIT license.

8. **`package-lock.json`** (See `package.json` below, first). This is an automatically generated file based on the exact versions of your npm dependencies that were installed for your project. **(You won’t change this file directly).**

9. **`package.json`**: A manifest file for Node.js projects, which includes things like metadata (the project’s name, author, etc). This manifest is how npm knows which packages to install for your project.

10. **`README.md`**: A text file containing useful reference information about your project.
